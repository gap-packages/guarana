  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YInstalling this package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  Guarana  package  is  part  of  the standard distribution of [5XGAP[105X and so
  normally  there should be no need to install it separately. If by any chance
  it  is  not  part  of  your [5XGAP[105X distribution, then the standard method is to
  unpack  the  package into the `pkg' directory of your [5XGAP[105X distribution. This
  will  create a `guarana' subdirectory. For other non-standard options please
  see  Chapter  [14X'Reference:  Installing  a  GAP  Package'[114X of the [5XGAP[105X Reference
  Manual.  Note  that  the  GAP-Packages Polycyclic and Polenta are needed for
  this  package.  Normally  they  should be contained in your distribution. If
  not,           they           can           be          obtained          at

  [33X[0;0YIf  the  [5XGuarana[105X  Package  is not already loaded then you have to request it
  explicitly.  This can be done by `LoadPackage("guarana")'. The `LoadPackage'
  command  is  described  in  Section  [14X'Reference:  LoadPackage'[114X  in  the  [5XGAP[105X
  Reference Manual.[133X
